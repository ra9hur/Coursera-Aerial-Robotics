**Course Syllabus**

Week1 - Introduction to Aerial Robotics

- In this week, you will be introduced to the exciting field of Unmanned Aerial Robotics (UAVs) and quadrotors in particular.
- You will learn about their basic mechanics and control strategies and realize how careful component selection and design affect the vehicles' performance.

Week2 - Geometry and Mechanics

- In this week, we will first focus on the kinematics of quadrotors. 
- Then, you will learn how to derive the dynamic equations of motion for quadrotors. 
- Develop planar and three-dimensional dynamic models of the quadrotor.
- To build a better understanding on these notions, some essential mathematical tools are discussed in supplementary material lectures.
- Assignment: 1-D Quadrotor Control

Week3 - Planning and Control

- This week, you will learn more about how to develop linear controllers for these models. 
- With this knowledge, you will be required to complete the second programming assignment of this course, which focuses on controlling the quadrotor in two dimensions.
- Assignment: 2-D Quadrotor Control

Week4 - Advanced Topics

- So far, we have gone over the basics of developing linear controllers for quadrotors and motion planning. 
- In this last week of the course, we will discuss some more advanced material on how to enable quadrotors to perform more agile maneuvers and to operate autonomously in teams. 
- Note that the last programming assignment on quadrotor control in three dimensions uses material from the previous weeks. 
- Assignment: 3-D Quadrotor Control
